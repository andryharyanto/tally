# tally
Tally is your finance team's conversational program manager. Just talk to it, "analyzed invoices for Acme" or "waiting on vendor payment" - and it updates a shared board everyone sees. No boxes or dropdowns. Handles invoice tracking, monthly close, model changes. Want a new workflow? Ask for it. It's PM software that works like humans actually work
